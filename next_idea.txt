- you are a teacher you receive 20 stories, you want to be fair but u want to read the least amount of stories - what should u do 
in order to sign that these are trustworthy scores - what data is needed for the teacher so the teacher can be convinced that 
this is s a fair evaluation?

- damage the story manually
- 10 - 10 stories, copies that enel will create will damage them in a subtle way, and fatima will do it in a
different subtle way, and eac hwill figure out how the other damaged the story

- the high level idea is:
    you manually rate the story, and instead of the individiual rating, how can we do it in bulk?
