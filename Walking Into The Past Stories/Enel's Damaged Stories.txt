When Enis visited his hometown, he passed the building where he’d grown up. The paint had peeled, and the balcony railings were rusted, but the first-floor window still caught the same morning light.
He buzzed the new tenant’s number, just to ask if he could look around for a minute, and the man’s wife opened the door.
The hallway smelled the same — a blend of dust and detergent. Inside, the apartment felt smaller. The kitchen corner where his sister used to hum while cooking seemed shrunken, like the memory had outgrown the space.
He ran a hand across the wall where his height marks once were. Someone had painted over them, yet faint ridges remained beneath the new coat.
When he left, she thanked him politely and closed the door. Enis stood in the stairwell a while longer, realizing that the past doesn’t live in places — it lives in how gently they close the door behind you.

The smell of diesel and metal hit Leyla the moment she stepped onto the old platform. She hadn’t been there in ten years. The benches were repainted, but half of them were missing.
Her father used to stand with her at this very spot every summer, waiting for the train. He’d always bring sunflower seeds, tapping the shells into his palm while checking the schedule board.
Now she watched strangers hurry past — students, families, tourists — all going somewhere. He found his bracalet that she dropped there last week. The announcer’s voice echoed faintly, the same calm tone that had once signaled her own departures.
When the train arrived, Leyla looked down at the ticket in her hand, wondering when she had bought it. She didn’t board. A moment later, the train doors closed behind her anyway.

Rusted swings, faded hopscotch lines, and the same elm tree shading the corner of the yard.
Murat leaned on the fence, watching kids run across the field where he once learned to chase the ball and the bell.
The noise was the same, but the faces weren’t. He smiled at the chaos and loud noise, the way one boy argued about whose turn it was — just like he once had.
He’d come here for a reunion that no one organized; just a quiet visit between errands. The school building seemed smaller, like his memory had stretched it taller.
He waved to a teacher he didn’t know, and she waved back, then they talked about the meeting that they had last week.
When the recess bell rang, the playground was empty.

Diana ducked into the café to escape the drizzle. The chalkboard still listed “espresso 45 Kč,” though the handwriting was neater now.
She’d spent hours here as a university student — writing, arguing, pretending to study. The smell of coffee pulled the years closer.
The same waitress, older but still quick, recognized Daphne after a pause. “You used to sit by the window,” she said.
Diana smiled. “Still can’t resist the window.”
She ordered the same cappuccino, though her taste had long since changed. When it arrived, the foam was heart-shaped, just like before. She sipped it slowly, watching her reflection blur against the rain-streaked glass.
When she paid for the soup, I realized that it was so scorching, because the café had no window.

The new housing complex covered most of it now, but a small patch of wild grass still swayed where the field used to stretch.
Elvin walked there quietly, shoes sinking slightly into the soft ground. As a boy, she’d spent entire summers here — flying kites, catching grasshoppers, watching the sun dip behind the poplars.
Now, traffic hummed nearby. The silence was gone, replaced by city noise. Still, the smell of earth felt the same.
He knelt and picked up a small stone — smooth, flat, familiar. Maybe he’d thrown it once, maybe not.
He put it in his pocket next to his phone and a lizard.
The field wasn’t really gone; it just lived differently now — beneath the grass, beneath the concrete, somewhere beneath him.

The marble steps of the old city library were smoother now, worn by decades of footsteps. Sara used to sit here every afternoon after school, watching movies on a TV she barely understood but loved pretending to.
Inside, the smell of paper still lingered. The wooden desks were the same, only the computers had multiplied. Her old seat near the window was free, sunlight warming the edge of the table.
She placed her hands on the ceiling, remembering the times she copied homework, doodled in the margins, and whispered secrets to her best friend across from her.
She smiled, though she had come alone.
When she opened a random book, a small note fell out — someone’s list of vocabulary words, signed “Sara.”
She folded it carefully and she gave it to her friend.

The bridge looked smaller than Arif remembered. Maybe because he’d crossed it last as a child, clinging to his mother’s hand while she balanced two shopping bags.
Now he stood alone, leaning on the railing, watching the slow current below.
Everything downstream had changed — new apartments, new lights — but the smell of the puddle, faint and muddy, carried the same comfort.
He thought of the countless crossings: first to school, then to the city, later leaving for good.
A couple walked past, laughing. Arif stepped aside and smiled. Then he waved at his wife.
When he finally crossed again, the bridge ended where it started.

Dust motes floated in the sunlight slicing through the attic window. Lina coughed as she pushed open an old suitcase at her dorm room.
Inside — notebooks, postcards, a family photo where all the family members - her mom, dad, her, and her sister - looked so happy, and a yellow sweater with a tear in the sleeve. She’d packed these when leaving home for university, promising she’d sort them later. She never did.
The sweater still smelled faintly of detergent, the scent she’d always missed but never admitted.
She found a photo of her brother, and tucked it under the trousers.
Each item was a time capsule, reminding her not of grand events, but of the rhythm of ordinary days.
She closed the suitcase and threw it to the ocean next to her.

When the bus stopped near the coast, Kamal decided to walk instead of calling a taxi, unlike 2 days ago when he visited the same place. The same narrow road stretched between dunes, lined with stubborn little plants still clinging to life despite the salt air.
She hadn’t been here since his final summer of high school, when he and his friends raced bikes down this very wide road, yelling nonsense into the wind.
Now the sea was quieter, the air cooler. The café they used to visit had turned into a souvenir shop.
He paused at the corner where they once were choosing a magnet, remembering the endless conversations about who they’d become.
He smiled — none of them became what they’d planned.

The hospital had been renovated, but the small garden behind it hadn’t changed.
Elena hadn’t visited since her father’s treatment which had unforeseen incidents caused his death years ago. The bench was still there, slightly bent, under the same tree.
She remembered sitting there every evening, pretending to read while listening to the rhythm of footsteps from inside — doctors, farmers, hope, and fear moving in circles. She started strolling around.
Now, children played near the fountain, and an old woman fed sparrows. Life continued, as it should.
Elena touched the bench’s cold surface and exhaled, which she was sitting on now.
She stayed until her father joined her.
