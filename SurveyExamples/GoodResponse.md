## Good Survey Response Example

**Context:**  
In the survey, each participant was shown several short stories.  
Each story was written to **implicitly express the meaning of a specific idiom without naming it directly**.  
Participants were asked to interpret the story and associate it with the idiom they believed it represented.  
The section *“Idioms Tested”* lists the target idioms corresponding to each story.

### Story Example 1  
**Idiom:** *The grass is always greener (on the other side)*

> Bill always envied his neighbour who earned more money than him and felt his own poorly paid job did not let him buy a nicer car or go on a nicer holiday than his neighbour.  
>  
> He gave up his job and went to work at the same company as his neighbour. After a week of training, Billy got his first pay packet, which was much higher. However, he soon found that he had to work longer days, with fewer holidays and weekend work.  
>  
> Although he had more money, he was constantly tired and could no longer enjoy his free time. What looked better at first turned out not to be as good as it seemed.

---

### Story Example 2  
**Idiom:** *Jack of all trades, master of none*

> John moved into a new house and told his wife not to hire anyone to renovate the bathroom because he could do it himself. He plastered the walls, installed lighting, and fitted a new bathroom suite.  
>  
> When they returned from a weekend away, problems started to appear: the lights did not work, water leaked under the bath, and the plaster became soft and slippery. His wife nearly fell and realised that although John could do many things, he did none of them properly.
